To install the back end:
    $ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
        -the -g flag is not allowed in 42, so I used instead
            -npm i @nestjs/cli
    $ nest new project-name
        -does not work because nestjs/cli is not installed globally
            -I used npx @nestjs/cli new backend
                -this created the backend as a git repo so ran
                    -rm -rf .git inside the backend folder
